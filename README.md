# CodeCourt

> A multi-agent PR review system that briefs human engineers before they decide to merge.

## The Problem

Engineers merge code every day under time pressure. A single missed SQL injection, a memory leak, or a poorly named function can cost hours of debugging or worse, a production incident. Human reviewers are good but not infallible. They get tired. They miss things.

## The Solution

CodeCourt deploys three specialist agents in parallel the moment a PR is ready for review:

- **SecurityScout** - hunts for vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, and injection risks
- **PerfProbe** - flags memory leaks, inefficient queries, and blocking operations
- **QualityGuard** - catches poor naming, duplication, and code smells

A fourth agent, CodeCourt itself, aggregates all findings into a structured briefing and hands it to the human engineer. The human always makes the final call.

## How It Works
```

## Built With

- gitagent - git-native agent standard
- gitclaw - agent runtime
- Claude Sonnet - underlying model

## Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/codecourt.git
cd codecourt

# Validate the agent
gitagent validate

# View agent info
gitagent info

# Export as system prompt
gitagent export --format system-prompt

# Export for Lyzr
gitagent export --format lyzr
```

## Sample Briefing Output
```
## CodeCourt Review Briefing

PR: Add user authentication middleware
Author: dev-user
Files changed: 4

### Summary
- CRITICAL: 1
- HIGH: 2
- MEDIUM: 1
- LOW: 3

### Security Findings (SecurityScout)
### CRITICAL - Security
- File: middleware/auth.js:23
- Issue: Hardcoded JWT secret key found
- Why it matters: Anyone with repo access can forge tokens
- Recommended action: Move to environment variable immediately

### Performance Findings (PerfProbe)
No performance issues found in this diff.

### Quality Findings (QualityGuard)
### MEDIUM - Quality
- File: middleware/auth.js:45
- Issue: Function handleAuth() does 6 different things
- Why it matters: Hard to test and maintain
- Recommended action: Split into smaller single-responsibility functions

HUMAN DECISION REQUIRED: [ Merge ] [ Request Changes ] [ Reject ]
```

## Design Principles

- **Human accountability first** - CodeCourt briefs, engineers decide. Always.
- **Separation of concerns** - Each specialist agent stays in its lane
- **Evidence-based findings** - No finding without a file and line reference
- **Compliance built in** - Full audit logging, human-in-the-loop enforcement
